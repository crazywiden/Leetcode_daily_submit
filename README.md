# Leetcode Daily Submit 
This project is used for leetcode daily submit. 

Each person should have a separate personal directory. In the directory, several files should be included. In principle, each file should be the solution for a single leetcode problem. However, the following conditions can be excluded:

1. Multiple solutions in a file
2. Problems of the same type in a file (e.g. *LC198--House Robber* and *LC213--House Robber II* )

for each solution, the following should be included:

1. Which problem is this solution trying to solve. Format should be: LC xxx--name (e.g. LC 264--ugly number II )
2.  Briefly explain the algorithm, at lease should contain __time complexity__ and __space complexity__. If the solution is from the internet, please attach the link
3.  The excution time and rank of the algorithm. You can find this after your solution is accepted by leetcode


Wish you good luck!
