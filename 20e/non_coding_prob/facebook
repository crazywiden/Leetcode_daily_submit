# Two Cards Same Suite(prob)
# What is the probability of drawing two cards (from the same deck of cards) that have the same suite?

PS:Four suits: clubs (♣), diamonds (♦), hearts (♥), and spades (♠).
pr = 13/52 * 12/51 * 4 = 12/51

(***)# Raining in Seattle(prob)
# You're about to get on a plane to Seattle. You want to know if you should bring an umbrella. 
You call 3 random friends of yours who live there and ask each independently if it's raining. 
Each of your friends has a 2/3 chance of telling you the truth and a 1/3 chance of messing with you by lying. 
All 3 friends tell you that "Yes" it is raining. What is the probability that it's actually raining in Seattle?

Original Answer:
pr(rain) = pr(3 truth) = (2/3)^3 = 8/27
Updated Answer:
pr(rain & 3 yes) = pr(3 truth) = (2/3)^3 = 8/27
pr(not rain & 3 yes) = pr(3 lie) = (1/3)^3 = 1/27
pr(rain| 3yes) = pr(3 truth) / (pr(3 truth) + pr(3 lie)) = 8/9

（***） # Var = E([X - E(X)]^2) 
# Expectation of Variance
# What is the expectation of the variance?
Answer:
Var(X)
= E([X - E(X)]^2) 
= E( X^2 + E^2[X] - 2*X*E[X] ) 
= E[X^2] + E^2[X] - 2*E[X]*E[X]
= E[X^2] - E^2[X]

E[Var(X)]
 = E[E[X^2] - E^2[X]]
 = E[X^2] - E^2[X]
 = Var(X)


# Active User Probability
# How would you test whether having more friends now increases the probability that a Facebook member is still an active user after 6 months?
# Answer
- do a retro analysis first, historically whether customers with more friends 6 months ago has a higher probablity of being active now
- based on the retro analysis, form hypothsis about:
  - define positive and negative case, active? more friends
  - how to segment traffics, each segment has a different pattern regarding to this
  - the distribution of probablity of being active 6 months after 
     => define the minimal significant difference, 
     => what the control/significant group distribution should look like
     => what's the sample size needed to determine significance
     => any periodical change need to be covered?
     => decide which and how many traffic and how long would be needed
  - Bar plot visualizations
  - Correlation between #friends and binary active users after 6 months classification -> Point-biserial correlation. 
  - Logistic regression: predict user activity with a 6-month time delay based on #friends and evaluate the model.
  - Hypothesis test: ANOVA with ratios of active users after 6 months and #friends at t = 0.

# Mean, Median Age in Mexico [statistics]
# In Mexico, if you take the mean and the median age, which one will be higher and why?
Solution:
- step one: Distribution
  if it is normaly distribution (symetrically), mean == median
  if it is right-skewed, mean > median
  if it is left-skewed, mean < median
- check the data
  what the distribution of Age in Mexico => constantly right-skewed
  list some quantiles to show the distribution:
    - Age xxx-xxx takes xxx%
- conclusion: Thus, mean > median



# Three Ants
# Three ants are sitting at the three corners of an equilateral triangle. 
# Each ant starts randomly picks a direction and starts to move along the edge of the triangle. 
# What is the probability that none of the ants collide?
Answer:
Pr = 2 / 2^3 = 0.25


# Unfair Coin (probability)
# You randomly draw a coin from 100 coins 
# 1 unfair coin (head-head), 
# 99 fair coins (head-tail) and roll it 10 times. 
# If the result is 10 heads, what's the probability that the coin is unfair?
Answer:
Pr(10 heads & unfair|10 heads) 
= Pr(10 heads & unfair) / (Pr(10 heads & unfair) +  Pr(10 heads & fair))
= (1/100) * 1 / ((1/100) * 1 + (99/100)*(1/2)^10)
= 0.9118
Solution: the same

****combination and permutation
****if some information I consider necessary to move on, just assume it is X to move forward
****then give an example
****\sum_1^n i*p^i = p*(n*p^(n+1) - (n+1)*p^n + 1) / (p-1)^2
****\sum_1^\inf i*p^(i-1) = 1/(1-p)^2
# Expected Payout (probability)
# You're at a casino with two dice, 
# if you roll a 5 you win, and get paid $10. 
# What is your expected payout? 
# If you play until you win (however long that takes) then stop, what is your expected payout?
Answer:
1. Expected_payout = 1/(8/36) = 5
2. Expected_payout = 1*(2/9) + 2*(7/9)*(2/9) + 3*(7/9)^2*(2/9) +...
= (2/9) * \sum_i*(7/9)^(i-1)
= (2/9) * (1/(1-7/9)^2)
= 9/2
Solution:
1. p = 4/36 = 1/9 (not 2/9, it's combination not arrangement!!!!)
=> term of payout = 9
2. Assume each round charges x, expected payout = 9*(-x) + 10



**** hypo, process, result
# Used by Different Groups (statics)
# We have a product that is getting used differently by two different groups. 
# What is your hypothesis about why and how would you go about testing it?
Answer
set some outcome metrics
hypothesis: null hypo, outcome metrics is the same between groups. alter hypo, outcome metrics is different between groups.
test: retro analysis + business acumen => significance level & sample size => collect data to do two-sample t-test
result: if difference is greater than significance level => alter wins, otherwise, null wins
