# Two Cards Same Suite(prob)
# What is the probability of drawing two cards (from the same deck of cards) that have the same suite?

PS:Four suits: clubs (♣), diamonds (♦), hearts (♥), and spades (♠).
pr = 13/52 * 12/51 * 4 = 12/51

(***)# Raining in Seattle(prob)
# You're about to get on a plane to Seattle. You want to know if you should bring an umbrella. 
You call 3 random friends of yours who live there and ask each independently if it's raining. 
Each of your friends has a 2/3 chance of telling you the truth and a 1/3 chance of messing with you by lying. 
All 3 friends tell you that "Yes" it is raining. What is the probability that it's actually raining in Seattle?

Original Answer:
pr(rain) = pr(3 truth) = (2/3)^3 = 8/27
Updated Answer:
pr(rain & 3 yes) = pr(3 truth) = (2/3)^3 = 8/27
pr(not rain & 3 yes) = pr(3 lie) = (1/3)^3 = 1/27
pr(rain| 3yes) = pr(3 truth) / (pr(3 truth) + pr(3 lie)) = 8/9

（***） # Var = E([X - E(X)]^2) 
# Expectation of Variance
# What is the expectation of the variance?
Answer:
Var(X)
= E([X - E(X)]^2) 
= E( X^2 + E^2[X] - 2*X*E[X] ) 
= E[X^2] + E^2[X] - 2*E[X]*E[X]
= E[X^2] - E^2[X]

E[Var(X)]
 = E[E[X^2] - E^2[X]]
 = E[X^2] - E^2[X]
 = Var(X)


# Active User Probability
# How would you test whether having more friends now increases the probability that a Facebook member is still an active user after 6 months?
# Answer
- do a retro analysis first, historically whether customers with more friends 6 months ago has a higher probablity of being active now
- based on the retro analysis, form hypothsis about:
  - define positive and negative case, active? more friends
  - how to segment traffics, each segment has a different pattern regarding to this
  - the distribution of probablity of being active 6 months after 
     => define the minimal significant difference, 
     => what the control/significant group distribution should look like
     => what's the sample size needed to determine significance
     => any periodical change need to be covered?
     => decide which and how many traffic and how long would be needed
  - Bar plot visualizations
  - Correlation between #friends and binary active users after 6 months classification -> Point-biserial correlation. 
  - Logistic regression: predict user activity with a 6-month time delay based on #friends and evaluate the model.
  - Hypothesis test: ANOVA with ratios of active users after 6 months and #friends at t = 0.
